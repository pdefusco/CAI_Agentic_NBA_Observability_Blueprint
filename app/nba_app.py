"""Next-Best-Action multi-turn chatbot demo.

A LangGraph pipeline that guides a bank customer through a short conversation,
applies a customer-risk guardrail, consults a local SQLite rule engine of
credit-card offers, and presents the best-fit offer in-chat.  Fully traced
through LangSmith with a per-thread ``thread_id`` so the entire conversation
appears as one thread in the LangSmith Threads tab.

The risk guardrail is currently a **rules-based placeholder** that reads
``state["customer_record"]`` and applies a few if/else checks (see
``_rules_based_risk_score``).  An ML-backed guardrail (XGBoost or PyTorch,
served via Cloudera AI Inference Service) is scaffolded under
``xgboost/`` and ``pytorch_train/`` for future re-enablement — swap the
call in ``risk_guardrail_node`` back to the model endpoint when ready.

Runs as a Cloudera AI Application via ``launch_app.py``.
